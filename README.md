## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview
In this project, I recreated a simplified version of an Instagram profile page focusing on CSS layout and styling. This involved applying various CSS techniques to achieve a responsive, aesthetically pleasing design that functions well across different devices.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: I feel confident in using Flexbox and Grid to structure web page elements. Implementing these elemrnts was challenging but it ended up being my highlights of my intagram web page.
- **Responsive Design**:I succesfully created instagram queries reflecting on an Instagram mobile app to make sure it looks good on desktop and mobile device. 
- **Styling Elements**: I was able to style the profile image, user information, and gallery section effectively, closely resembling an Instagram profile.  

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**:Maintaining a clean code throughout the project was a challenge because ended up using Javascript on CSS .Adding certain features which required me to add Javascript was difficult until I took on few challenges that helped to work on the required elements.: Adjusting layouts and font sizes for smaller screens was challenging. I had to experiment with different approaches to ensure the design remained consistent and functional.
- **Hover and Focus Effects**:Implementing interactive elements like hover and focus effects required more practice and research to get them right.I was able to use it on profile section(like buttom ).

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: I want to explore more advanced CSS properties and animations to enhance the user experience. 
- **Code Optimization**: My code archieved a desired outcome and I'll improve in CSS properties and animations to enhance user experience.
- **Creative Design Choices**:I adhered closely to the Instagram layout for practice but would like to experiment with more creative design choices in future projects.

#### Overall Learning Experience
-This project was hands-on experience in applying CSS layout techniques. It helped understand  my understanding of CSS to its practical applications in web development. I look forward to building on these skills in future projects to enhance my knowledge and challenge myself.
